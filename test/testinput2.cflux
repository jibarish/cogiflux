@quote "Money is an amplifier. It brings out and exaggerates what is already there. When dealing with a good and honorable person, money entering the equation will make them even more so. The opposite, however, is also true! Be wise as to who you choose for a partner; often enough the profit is just not worth it!" - Ben Leybovich, 20 Ways to Buy an Investment Property with 2000 or less

@quote "However, you should know that ability to finance property is predicated on different factors in the Single Family and Small Multiplex markets versus the commercial space. Without going into great detail, let me just say that on the commercial side it is the asset that qualifies for the loan more so than you or your personal income. In very broad terms, you may actually benefit from playing on the commercial side." - Ben Leybovich, 20 Ways to Buy an Investment Property with 2000 or less

@do @life develop a system to finally start organizing, bug tracking, and tracking the development of software projects.  A major goal of this is to keep projects alive and see them through to a finish.  A past pattern I would like to change has been an initial

@i @life develop a lexicon to help you describe, think intelligently, effectively, efficiently about your life.  For example, the term "antipattern" is good to describe something you might be inclined to call a "problem."  It's better because it's cleaner, more accurate, and implies its solution with its own definition.  The lexicon of a given domain is actually a potentially very important and overlooked limiting factor in your ability to think and solve problems within that domain.  Without an established lexicon (and system of semantics - this is a more complex issue which requires more thought) too much energy is spent struggling over how to describe issues, which is merely the first step and should be as smooth as possible.

@learn latin

@do_dev syntax highlighting for markup language in dev for cogiflux input (of which this is an example). So far the only designating symbols used are '@', '-', '{', '}'. But designations are made using spaces and newlines as well.

@i_dev develop natural language processing engine which takes natural language commands as input and translates them into sql queries (or whatever). (Eg. "list movies to watch with steph" --> select dm.title, dm.type, c.name as "with" from do_media dm, confrere c where c.id = dm.association and c.name = 'Steph';)

@idea_story Caleb told story about how if he were a millionaire he would cold call random people, read through a telemarketing script, and if they were nice, at the end he'd give them $100k (b/c he;s a former telemarketer).  So the extension is that former employees of whatever kind would all do this differently.
